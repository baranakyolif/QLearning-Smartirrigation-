# QLearning-Smartirrigation-
 The aim here was to develop a simulation that provides synthetic data compatible with real data to increase data diversity while fine-tuning the Llama3 model.   These codes simulate a series of steps that determine the amount of irrigation based on climate data and back up the resulting dataset in csv format.
